  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This Korean fried chicken recipe is officially my favorite. I've had every style of fried chicken known to man, so I've always considered myself an expert. No other method I've come across has the same combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
    <li>½ yellow onion, grated</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine chicken, onion, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine cornstarch, flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk in water until batter is the consistency of heavy cream. Add chicken pieces to batter and mix until each piece is coated.</li>
    <li>Fry chicken, working in batches, until golden brown and no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain on paper towels.</li>
